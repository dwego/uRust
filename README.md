# µRust (uRust)

uRust is an experimental open-source runtime and tooling ecosystem for running Rust on ESP32 microcontrollers, starting with the ESP32-WROOM-32D.
The goal is to provide a clean, modular foundation for firmware development, edge-AI experiments, and future quantized models (8-bit, 1-bit, etc.).

This repository hosts the earliest work toward:

- a minimal Rust firmware for ESP32

- a simple hardware abstraction layer

- a future unified CLI (urust)

- an architecture that later supports modular apps and on-device AI

More details, documentation, and structure will evolve as the project grows.
